### End-user Broker Usage

CLoud Foundry end-users can create and bind services to their applications using the `cf` CLI application.

```
cf create-service ecs-bucket unlimited my_bucket
```

This creates a bucket of the `ecs-bucket` service with the `unlimited` plan and the name: `my-bucket`.  To bind
an application to this bucket:

```
cf bind-service my-app my-bucket
```

The default will give `my-app` "full control" of the bucket.  To give a reduced set of permissions, you can provide
additional configuration parameters with the `-c` flag:

```
cf bind-service my-app my-bucket -c '{"permissions": ["read", "write"]}'
```

Valid permissions include:
 * read
 * read_acl
 * write
 * write_acl
 * execute
 * full_control
 * privileged_write
 * delete
 * none
